This plugin shows Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google "+1", Pinterest and other popular social share buttons above or below your posts.
Easy customization of active buttons and position in the Settings menu.

In contrast to several other sharing plugin, this one aims to use only original code provided by any social network.
There is no other service in the middle, you are not required to register or get a key to use it. Enjoy!

Facebook Like, Twitter, Google +1 social share buttons and Follow by email are loaded by default. 
Other buttons, including Digg, Facebook Share, Flattr, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Stumbleupon, Youtube, Hyves, Print, Email, RSS, Reddit, Tipy, Tumblr, Buffer, Pinzout, SpecificFeeds, Draugiem.lv (Frype.com) can be added through the `Settings->Really simple share` menu. Follow by email is powered by ReadyGraph which provides an option for users to provide their email address without leaving your site, and sends email digests to users when you update your site content.

Please be careful when selecting the `Show buttons in these pages` options : it can interact badly with other slide/fade/carousel/sidebar active plugins.
 
This plugin has integrated [ReadyGraph](http://readygraph.com/), an optional set of features to automate the growth of your revenue and userbase.  It helps you achieve the most important goals of any web marketer: increase revenue, maximize conversion of site visitors to register for your email list, maximize viral referrals for your site, and maximize return visits to your site.  To accomplish this, we have integrated a key set of growth features with this plugin:

* Optionally maximize revenue with standardized, non-intrusive ad units. Optimized for mobile and web to increase revenue. Powered by hand selected partners including AdsOptimal. 
* Intelligent signup popup with email or one-click Facebook login
* Full viral referral flow
* Automated end user re-engagement emails including welcome emails, weekly digest, friend joined alert and more (all email campaigns are optional and configurable)
* Enhanced email deliverabilty
* Cloud-based analytics and data storage
* Settings that allow you to turn on and off all ReadyGraph features.
= Shortcode =

If you want to place the active buttons only in selected posts, use the [really_simple_share] shortcode.

If you want to place only one share button, add the *button* attribute to the shortcode, e.g.:

* [really_simple_share button="facebook_like"]
* [really_simple_share button="twitter"]
* [really_simple_share button="linkedin"]
* [really_simple_share button="pinterest"]
* [really_simple_share button="google1"]
* [really_simple_share button="digg"]
* [really_simple_share button="stumbleupon"]
* [really_simple_share button="reddit"]
* [really_simple_share button="flattr"]
* [really_simple_share button="tumblr"]
* [really_simple_share button="facebook_share"]
* and so on...

Please note that in order to place single share buttons, they have to be active in the plugin settings page.

= Selective disable =

If you want to hide the share buttons inside selected posts, set a "really_simple_share_disable" custom field with value "yes".

To do so e.g. on a page: open the WordPress backend, go to Pages, click on the Page title to enter the Page edit screen. Then you can add the custom field, [as explained here](http://www.carriedils.com/how-to-create-custom-fields-in-wordpress/ "How to Create Custom Fields in WordPress").

= ReadyGraph App =

ReadyGraph is a system that automates the growth of your site’s userbase. It is optimized to deliver audience growth and motivate users to consistently revisit your site.

= Optimized Signup Form =

ReadyGraph’s signup form with intelligent pop-up functionality and one-click login is designed to maximize signups to your email list.  You can configure when the popup appears so as to maximize the likelihood that the user is engaged enough to register for your list.

= Viral Friend Invites =

ReadyGraph adds a friend invite process to your site’s signup flow.  We then power the entire viral loop by sending email and Facebook invitations that encourage your visitors’ friends to signup for your site.

= Automated Re-engagement Emails =

ReadyGraph’s automated email system encourages visitors to return to your site.   Users receive optimized emails such as a welcome email, re-engagement email, regular digest with new content from your blog, and social emails.  All emails are configurable including the ability to turn on and off individual campaigns.  We handle all sending to maximize deliverability.

= Analytics =

Track daily-new subscribers, daily invites, total traffic, and other key metrics that quantify growth and user engagement.  ReadyGraph safely stores user data in the cloud so you can access data from anywhere.

= Newsfeed =

ReadyGraph’s newsfeed is an optional overlay on your site where your users can engage with others in your community and recommend your content or products to each other.  It is like having a social network that engages users embedded on your site. Users can leave comments, ‘like’ comments left by other subscribers and ‘follow’ other subscribers.  Subscribers will receive automated email updates based on these actions.

= Content Voting and Ranking =

ReadyGraph allows your subscribers to vote on your latest content. The top content from our network of sites is then ranked on UserBase.com by the number of votes that it has received in the past 7 days.

= Reference =

Previously known as "Really simple Facebook Twitter share buttons".

This plugin is based on previous work by Giuliano Polverari - [WhileTrue.it](WhileTrue.it)

== Installation ==
Installation Instruction and Configuration can also be found at [Installation Instruction and Configuration](http://blog.readygraph.com/really-simple-share/installation/)

Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure to put all of the plugin files in a folder named `really-simple-facebook-twitter-share-buttons` (not two nested folders) in the plugin directory, then activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
For detailed FAQ and other support visit [http://blog.readygraph.com/really-simple-share/faq/](http://blog.readygraph.com/really-simple-share/faq/)

= The settings page seems corrupted, some buttons labels are missing. How to solve it? =

Sometimes the options get corrupted after several plugin updates. 
Click the Reset button (on the lowest right of the plugin settings page) to give the plugin a fresh start. 
Please take a note of your plugin configuration before resetting the options, or remember the data you want to put back in.

= What's the difference between Facebook Like and Share buttons? =
Facebook Like is the official Button actively supported by Facebook.
On 18th July 2012 Facebook dropped support for the (old and long time deprecated) Share button, so this button has been removed from the plugin and replaced with an externali link with no counter.

= Why users can't choose which image to share when using Facebook Like button ? =
This is an automated Facebook behaviour: clicking Facebook Like the user can't choose each time which image to share, 
but you can set the right image inside the code using the 
<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">Open Graph Tag</a> og:image.

= When I activate the plugin it messes up with other plugins showing post excerpts in different ways (fade, carousel, sidebar). What can I do? =
Uncheck all the "Show buttons in these pages" options in the `Settings->Really simple share` menu, except for "Single posts".
This way all the share buttons should disappear, except the one displayed beside the post in every Single post page.

= Is it possible to modify the style/css of the buttons? =
Yes, every button has its own div class (e.g. "really_simple_share_twitter") for easy customization inside the theme css files.
Plus, the div surrounding all buttons has its own class "really_simple_share". 
If you want to override default styling of the buttons, check the `disable default styles` option add your style rules inside your css theme file.

= Is it possible to show the buttons anywhere inside my theme, using a PHP function? =
Yes, you can call this PHP function:
`<?php echo really_simple_share_publish($link='', $title=''); ?>` 
You can pass the share link and the title as parameters.
You shouldn't leave the parameters blank, unless the code is put inside the WP loop.
For example, use this code to create buttons linking to the website home page:
`<?php echo really_simple_share_publish(get_bloginfo('url'), get_bloginfo('name'));  ?>`

= Sometimes the Pinterest PinIt button doesn't appear in some posts. =
The PinIt button requires some media to share, so it only shows up when the post contains at least one image.

= I've cheched the "show counter" option in the Settings page, but sometimes the Pinterest PinIt button's counter doesn't appear. =
The PinIt counter only appear if the post has been shared at least once. Also, the refresh time for the PinIt counter could be long.
